Flax: Neural networks with JAX
====

Flax delivers an **end-to-end, flexible, user experience for researchers
who use JAX with neural networks**. Flax exposes the full power of JAX.
It is made up of loosely coupled libraries,
which are showcased with end-to-end integrated guides and examples. |emphasized hyperlink|_

Flax is used by `hundreds of projects (and growing) <https://github.com/google/flax/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS01MjEyMjA2MA%3D%3D>`__,
both in the open source community and within Google.
Notable examples include:

- `ðŸ¤— Hugging Face <https://huggingface.co/transformers/#supported-frameworks>`__ for NLP
- `NetKet <https://github.com/netket/netket>`__ for Quantum ML
- `T5x <https://github.com/google-research/t5x>`__ for large language models
- `Brax <https://github.com/google/brax>`__ for on-device differentiable 
  robotics simulations.
